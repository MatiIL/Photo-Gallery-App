### Project objectives

Build a React web application that displays a gallery of photos in a responsive grid layout.
The app should fetch photos from an API and present then in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly
manner.
Requirements:
- Use react functional components, prefer TS
- App should support up to 1,000,000 photos
- Fetch photos from a public mock API of your choice
 (etc. https://api.slingacademy.com/v1/sample-data/photos?offset=5&limit=2000)
- App must be responsive
- User can add photos links *
- User can delete photo or multiple photos *
- App can display chosen photo in an enlarged view
* Does not need to be persistent, user can add and delete items in the browser but any changes will be 
reset after refreshing the page
Technical Considerations:
- Clean, readable and maintainable code
- Performance considerations
- Code run without issues
- responsive and clean app
- Organize code and modules
